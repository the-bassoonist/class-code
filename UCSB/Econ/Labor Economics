* Re formatting stuff that was improperly imported from excel. 4% in excel read as .04 in STATA. replace commands fix the problem. Other issue is that values would read as 4.00 when we only need 4. Format command fixes this issue. Date is reformatted for readability
lab var a Date // a did not have a label, so I am labeling it. 
format a %tdnn/dd/YY //formatting date
format (j k m r s) %10.0g //formatting for sigfigs. Instead of getting something like 4.00 on graphs I will now get 4
//somep ercentages like 4% got exported to .04. Multiplied by 100 to fix the issue.  
replace k = k*100
replace m = m*100
replace r = r*100
* Graphs are plotted using scatter command. Additional axis and other information are added after the first comma. Exportation is occurring with a high res jpg. Currently unsure of how to export into a vector format.
