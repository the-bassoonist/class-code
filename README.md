# Welcome!
This repository holds all the code I have written at Irvine Valley College, Saddleback College and UC Santa Barbara.
IVC and SC will be under CC_Code, here you will find my intro code and you can see the fundamentals I have.
UCSB will be under UCSB_Code, here will be my more interesting code for upper division classes. 
Since I have a dual BA/BS, UCSB_code is divided between the code I have written at with the Department of Economics and the Department of Statistics and Applied Probabilities.
